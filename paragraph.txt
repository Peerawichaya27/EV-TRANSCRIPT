Now, I want the token.json to store only one proof. The token.json will sent to verify on the blockchain. 
The proof will verify first, which the employer will generate the proof and then compare with the proof in the token.json. 
If the proof is verified, the blockchain then extract the hashed VC from VP that stored in the token.json. 
The blockchain then take the student's DID from the token.json and find the index that linked by that student's DID, 
which the student's DID linked with index of the hashed VC that stored in the ipfs.json will be stored onto the blockchain at first. 
The blockchain then use that index to retrieve the hashed VC from the ipfs.json. 
After that, the blockchain will compared the hashed VC retrieved from the VP with the hashed VC retrieved from the ipfs.json. 
If the hashed VC matched, it will return VC valid to the employer.
